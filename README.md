# MTG EV Calculator

## What it doesn't do
- Doesn't really calculate ev
- Isn't really broadly for MTG
- Most of the stuff you would probably want it to do

## What it does do
- Simulates approximate value for the 3 main jumpstart sets using possibly the simplest monte carlo simulation of all time
- Lets you filter out cards that are worth nothing and thus will never sell ever
- Shows you results that are probably intuitive
- Uses really inefficient data structures that were too much effort to change once I realized how bad I developed the code
- make pretty graph
